# target-atjs-extensions
Adobe Target extensions to at.js--the new library for Adobe Target.  At the moment these are mostly for supporting Target in Single Page Application environments. 

* [Wiki](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/target-atjs-extensions/wiki)
* [Demos](http://adobe-marketing-cloud.github.io/target-sdk-libraries/demos/)
* [Issues](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/target-atjs-extensions/issues): please send feedback and questions through Github issues and we will respond as best we can.  These extensions are not supported by Adobe Client Care or Target Engineering.
* /src/ contains the original extension source code, uncompressed with comments.

These extensions are provided free to developers as a starting point to integrate at.js with their single page application. Customization may be required to integrate successfully with your single page app.
