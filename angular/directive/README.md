# at-angular-directive
> Angular Directive Adobe Target **at.js** extension  
> This provides the `mbox` Angular directive, and also allows for its automatic applying/appending to elements matched by a given CSS selector.

## Overview

This extension adds a `mbox` **directive** provider to your Angular module, which fetches and applies Target offers via **at.js** API, based on provided options.  
Additionally, in case a CSS selector is provided in `selector` options property, `mbox` directive will be automatically set in matched elements' attributes (unless `appendToSelector: true` property is also set, in which case it will instead be appended as a separate `<div>` after each element).  
DOM elements matching the directive will remain hidden, until the offers are applied (or an error occures when fetching/applying them).  
**Note:** [`at-angular-common`](../common/)(`target-angular.common` Angular module) is used in, and comes bundled with the extension.

## Usage

```javascript
adobe.target.ext.angular.initDirective(app, options);
```

where `options` object contains custom **at.js** options.  

## Options

> In addition to **at.js** options, the following custom options can also be provided:

Property | Description
--------- | -----------
`selector` | If provided, the extension will attempt to set `mbox` directive in the attributes of elements matched by the selector
`appendToSelector` | Used together with `selector` option. If true, appends `mbox` directive as a separate `<div>` after each matched element, instead of setting it in element attributes

## Notes and known issues

* **Note:** in case a `selector` is provided with `appendToSelector: false`, the extension will overwrite the `id` attribute of the matched elements;
* In some Angular apps using partial views, the auto-setting of `mbox` directives based on a provided selector may not function.  
This may happen due to the DOM elements to be matched by the selector being unavailable at the moment of `$viewContentLoaded` hook execution.  
A proper (flicker-less) fix for this may be provided in a future version.
