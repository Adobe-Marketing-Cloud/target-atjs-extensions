# target-spa-extensions
Adobe Target extensions to at.js to support Single Page Application implementations. 

* /src/ contains the original extension source code, uncompressed with comments.
* /dist/ contains the compressed versions which you will probably want to use in your production environments.  (Uglify.js is used for compression).
* [Wiki](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/target-spa-extensions/wiki)
* [Demos](http://adobe-marketing-cloud.github.io/target-sdk-libraries/demos/)
* [Issues](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/target-spa-extensions/issues): please send feedback and questions through Github issues and we will respond as best we can.  These extensions are not supported by Adobe Client Care or Target Engineering.

These extensions are provided free to developers as a starting point to integrate at.js with their single page application. Customization may be required to integrate successfully with your single page app, with which Adobe Consulting can help. Use at you own risk.
