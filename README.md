Adobe Target extensions to at.js to support Single Page Application implementations

This repository contains extensions for at.js--a new javascript library for Adobe Target--to enhance implementations in single page applications.  These extensions are provided free to developers as a starting point to integrate at.js with their single page application.  

* /src/ contains the original extension source code, uncompressed with comments.
* /dist/ contains the compressed versions which you will probably want to use in your production environments.  (Uglify.js is used for compression).

* [Wiki](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/target-spa-extensions/wiki): please see the wiki for documentation
* [Demos](http://adobe-marketing-cloud.github.io/target-sdk-libraries/demos/): please see the demos to see the extensions in Action
* [Issues](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/target-spa-extensions/issues): please send feedback and questions through Github issues and we will respond as best we can.  

Customization may be required to integrate successfully with your single page app, with which Adobe Consulting can help. Use at you own risk.  Please use github to open issues, give feedback, etc.  These extensions are not supported by Adobe Client Care or Target Engineering.
