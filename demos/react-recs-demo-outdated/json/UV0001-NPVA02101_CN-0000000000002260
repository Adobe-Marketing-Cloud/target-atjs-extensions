Milo and Otis start life together on a farm and spend their days exploring the barnyard and the surrounding countryside. One day the little feline is swept down a rushing river,  and Otis takes off in pursuit to rescue his friend,  thus beginning a series of amusing and sometimes scary adventures \"peopled\" by many other animals but not by one human being. One of the highest-grossing films ever in Japan,  it was shot over a period of four years on the island of Hokkaido at the farm of Hata,  a trained zoologist known to his millions of readers as Mutsugoro.","value":1299,"margin":0,"inventory":0,"country":["CA"],"gameType":["null"],"franchise":["null"],"titleId":["null"],"actorName":["dudley_moore_narrator"],"language":["en"],"pstp":["false"],"purchasablePlatform-1":["true"],"title":"The Adventures of Milo and Otis","numberOfPlayers":["null"],"ageLimit":["0"],"gameContentRating":["null"],"directorName":["masonori_hata"],"era":["null"],"seasonName":["null"],"genre":["family_kids"],"top_category":["film"],"primaryClassification":["null"],"secondaryClassification":["null"],"playablePlatform-ps4":["false"],"playablePlatform-ps3":["false"],"gameSubType":["null"],"playablePlatform-psp":["false"],"productId":["UV0001-NPVA02101_CN-0000000000002260"],"seriesName":["The Adventures of Milo and Otis"],"videoType":["film"],"playablePlatform-vita":["false"],"purchasablePlatform-13":["true"],"purchasablePlatform-10":["true"],"videoGenre":["family"],"playType":["null"],"release_date":["1989-01-01T00:00:00Z"],"publisher":["null"],"developer":["null"],"region":["SCEA"],"tertiaryClassification":["null"],"categories":["video"],"lastUpdated":1467850243754}
